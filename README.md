# Simple DLL Injector

This is a simple and basic DLL injector tool for Windows. It allows you to inject a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) into a running process.

## Disclaimer

**Use this tool at your own risk.** Injecting DLLs into processes can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, security vulnerabilities, and potential harm to your system or other applications. The developer is not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by this tool. **Use it only for ethical testing and debugging purposes on processes you own or have explicit permission to modify.**

## Features

* Lists currently running processes.
* Allows you to select a target process by its window title.
* Provides a simple interface to browse and select a DLL file to inject.
* Basic "Refresh" button to update the process list.
* **(Optional - If you included memory features)** Basic memory searching for integer values within the selected process.
* **(Optional - If you included memory features)** Basic memory replacing of integer values at a selected address.

## How to Use

1.  **Run the DLL Injector executable.**
2.  **Process Selection:**
    * The application will display a list of currently running processes (identified by their main window title).
    * Select the target process you want to inject the DLL into from the list.
    * Click the "Refresh" button if the process you are looking for is not visible.
3.  **DLL Selection:**
    * Click the "Browse" button next to the DLL Path field.
    * Navigate to the location of the DLL file you want to inject and select it. The path to the DLL will be displayed in the text field.
4.  **Injection:**
    * Once a process is selected and a DLL path is provided, click the "Inject" button.
    * The tool will attempt to inject the specified DLL into the target process.
    * **Note:** Success or failure of the injection might not always be explicitly indicated by this simple tool. Check the behavior of the target process.
5.  **(Optional - If you included memory features) Memory Searching:**
    * Select a target process.
    * Enter an integer value you want to search for in the "Search Value" field.
    * Click the "Search" button.
    * Any memory addresses containing that integer value in the selected process will be listed below.
6.  **(Optional - If you included memory features) Memory Replacing:**
    * Select a target process and perform a memory search first.
    * Select an address from the "Found Addresses" list.
    * Enter the new integer value you want to write in the "Replace Value" field.
    * Click the "Replace" button.
    * The integer value at the selected address in the target process will be overwritten.

## Building from Source

If you want to build this DLL Injector from the source code:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * A compatible C++ compiler (e.g., Microsoft Visual Studio).
    * Windows SDK.
2.  **Steps:**
    * Clone or download the source code.
    * Open the project file (if provided) in your C++ development environment.
    * Ensure the necessary Windows libraries (e.g., `user32.lib`, `kernel32.lib`, `psapi.lib`, `comdlg32.lib`) are linked.
    * Build the project. The resulting executable will be in the project's output directory.

## Limitations

* This is a basic implementation and may not work with all processes or DLLs.
* Error handling is minimal.
* Advanced injection techniques are not implemented.
* **(If basic)** Only lists processes by their main window title, which might not be unique.
* **(If basic)** Memory searching and replacing are limited to integer values.
